### VIM
  I've installed vim plug for the plugins that I use and the rest of the setup is from a youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA2WjJbmmoM&t=1351s

### TMUX
  I've installed tmux config from https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux and then just replaced the battery percentage bar to vbar and removed the up time, also I enabled the the powerline symbols.
